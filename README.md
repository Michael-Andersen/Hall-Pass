# Hall-Pass
Hall-Pass was created by a team of students as part of the 2018 BCIT CST Hackathon which took place January 3rd and 4th.
The Hackathon teams were tasked with coming up with an idea for an application that would be useful to all BCIT students.
The Hall-Pass team decided on an app which helped students locate washrooms, power outlets, and microwaves.
The team followed the principles of agile development to create a prototype implementation of this application over the course of 30 hours.
The Hall-Pass web application takes the form of an interactive map allowing users to specify the resource they are looking for 
and get detailed information about the location of that resourse on the BCIT campus.
The prototype was developed as a quick demonstration of the possiblities of this kind of app and is not intended as a fully functional 
implementation.
